<h1 align="center">Remove YouTube Video Blur</h1>
<p align="center">Small extension that removes that annoying and distracting blur that occurs in YouTube's new interface change</p>

**Depreciation! This addon is no longer needed:** YouTube has started to push this effect on more users but they have now added a setting to disable this (*finally*), therefore I am archiving this repo, this addon was meant for the people who had this feature forced on without a option to even turn it off
